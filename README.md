# ArabicToRomanNumeralConverter
Converts Arabic numbers to Roman Numerals, using Scala
I saw an example of someone (badly) converting arabic numerals to roman numerals on /r/programminghorror: https://redd.it/3y4y0j 
I decided to try it out in scala and get the line count as low as possible. Excluding comments and main method, this one is 12 lines
Builds with SBT, compiles with Scala 2.12.0
Runs with 'sbt run"
